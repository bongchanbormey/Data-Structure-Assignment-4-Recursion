# Data-Structure-Assignment-4-Recursion
### Project Requirements
1. Solve the following problems:
   - (a) Implement a method that take an input n and return the sum of all non-negative integers up to n.
   - (b) Implement a method that take an input n and return the multiplication of all non-negative intergers up to n.
   - (c) Implement a method that takes an input n and return the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.
   - (d) Implement a method that takes a string as an input and returns its reverse.
   - (e) Implement a method that takes a string and a char as inputs and returns true if the char exists in the string or false if it’s not in the string.
   - (f) Implement a method to find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers n and m.
   - (g) Implement a method that takes two inputs n and m and returns the number of unique paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of a n ∗ m grid. Constraints: the path can only move down or right by one unit at a time.
3. Implement a recursive solution and an iterative solution for each of the problems listed above as methods in the RecursiveSolution class, and the IterativeSolution class.
4. Name your method approciately. Both RecursiveSolution class, and the IterativeSolution class should have the same method names (solutions to above problems).
5. Both class may contain any number of other methods, as long as they are private.
